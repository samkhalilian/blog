Release Notes
=============

Versioning convention follows that described in `Python Dev Guide - Development Cycle <https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/development-cycle/>`_.

A release version X.Y.ZTN is tagged with a release level T.  Where X, Y, Z are the major, minor, bug fix versions and T is a, b, rc 
or null for alpha, beta, release candidates or public releases.  N represents the release level serial number:  

* New major versions are exceptional.  They are required when incompatible changes are necessary, and planned long in advance.

* New minor versions are feature releases and will be released periodically.

* New bugfixes are released as required.

* Alpha releases cover White box testing internal behaviour i.e. unit Tests.

* Beta releases cover Black box testing external behaviour i.e. regression or end user tests.

* Release candidates are pre-releases which include fixes for issues raised in Beta testing.

* Public releases are the final product relase to the public.
